This is a short project performing some data cleaning and wrangling with a Netflix dataset, as well as some final Exploratory Data Analysis. The project was developed in Google Collab using Python.

The dataset was downloaded for free from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ariyoomotade/netflix-data-cleaning-analysis-and-visualization.
