Hello again!

This R project is (mostly) a visual analysis of the NBA shots dataset that can be found on this [GitHub page](https://github.com/DomSamangy/NBA_Shots_04_22). There are some interesting trends uncovered as well as some ideas for future analysis!

You can find the full R script with outputs in this folder.
