Hello again!

This R project is (mostly) a visual analysis of the NBA shots dataset that can be found on this [GitHub page](https://github.com/DomSamangy/NBA_Shots_04_22). This dataset contains all shots taken from the 2003-04 season to 2021-22. 

There are some interesting trends uncovered as well as some ideas for future analysis!

You can find the full R script with outputs in the HTML file of this folder. You can also see the original R file with just the code.
